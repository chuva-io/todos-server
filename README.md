# Mission 🧕🏾 👨🏻‍💼 👩🏼‍💼
This project was created to supplement the [Swift Miami meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Swift-Miami/) and give the community - and more importantly, those new to Swift and/or software development - a place to build something together. It will serve as the backend for the Meetup's iOS [Todo List](https://github.com/chuva-io/TodoList) app.

We welcome and encourage diversity and collaboration from everyone.
